    <h1>About geocode.city</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="/">back to index</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an open source project with simple goals: fast, city-only geocoding.
      The data comes from the 
      <a href="http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/">geonames free data dump</a> for cities
      with a population of 500 or more (<code>cities500.zip</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/geocode-city/api">API</a> is built with Haskell and deployed on Heroku,
      backed by Postgres and Redis. It is free to use, with the following caveats:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All endpoints are suitable to be called from client-side or server-side applications.</li>
      <li>
        <em>No guarantees</em>: I run it on cheapo dynos, it should be pretty performant, but if you want
        greater assurances, you should consider deploying it yourself -- it should be straightforward
        to do so on Heroku/AWS/GCS, with a modified version of the provided Dockerfile and seed scripts.
      </li>
      <li>You can make up to <mark>1000 requests per IP, per day.</mark> 
        See <a href="#rate-limiting">the info on rate limiting</a></li>
      <li>If you need to make more than 1000 requests a day, drop me a note
      at <mark>geocode-city (at) lfborjas.com</mark> telling me about your project
      and I can give you an API key.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you notice anything amiss, please <a href="https://github.com/geocode-city/api/issues">file a bug report</a></p>

    <h2>Rate limiting</h2>

    <p>
      To prevent abuse, all API requests are rate limited; there's two methods: client IP, and API key.
      (you can see all of the below in action in the <a href="/docs.html">interactive documentation</a> )
    </p><p>
      You can include an API key either as the <code>api-key</code> querystring parameter or the
      <code>X-Geocode-City-Api-Key</code> custom header. If you omit it, your IP will be used. If your
      API key is invalid (or it has been revoked,) you'll receive responses with status <code>403 Forbidden</code>.
    </p><p>
      As mentioned above, a given IP can make up to 1000 requests/day. API keys give you up to 100,000 requests/month,
      but we can adjust that if you state your needs -- though beyond that, you probably want to deploy your own.
    </p><p>
      Once you reach your limit, a status of <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> will be returned in every response
      until the rate limit resets.
      The following headers are included in every response, to help you with rate limiting:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>X-RateLimit-Limit</code>: the number of requests in total you're allowed to make in a given period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>X-RateLimit-Remaining</code>: the number of requests left in a given time period, before you start
        getting <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> errors.
      </li>
      <li><code>X-RateLimit-Resets</code>A unix epoch (in decimal seconds) after which your can start making requests again.</li>
    </ul>
